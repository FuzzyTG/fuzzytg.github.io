# About Builder's Whetstone

Welcome to **Builder's Whetstone** — a space for thoughts on product thinking, AI-assisted building, and the logic that matters more than code.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog explores the shift from being a **passenger** to becoming a **driver** in the age of AI. It's not just about learning to code — it's about learning to think like a builder.

Topics include:
- **Product thinking**: Understanding what to build and why
- **AI-assisted development**: Using AI tools to turn ideas into reality
- **Logic over syntax**: Focusing on problem-solving rather than memorizing code
- **The builder's mindset**: How anyone can create, iterate, and ship

## Who Am I?

I'm someone who believes that in the AI era, the ability to think clearly about problems is more valuable than knowing syntax. I'm learning to build by building.

If you're curious about how ordinary people can become makers with the help of AI, this blog is for you.
