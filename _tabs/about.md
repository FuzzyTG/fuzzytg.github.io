# About

For years, I was a product manager. I knew *what* to build and *why*. I just couldn't build it myself.

Then AI changed the rules.

Now I'm learning to ship code, not just specs. This blog documents that transition: from passenger to driver, from PRDs to pull requests.

## What I Write About

- **Product thinking** when AI handles the syntax
- **The logic that matters** more than the code
- **Building in public** (currently: [Spar](https://www.getspar.app))

## Why "Builder's Whetstone"?

A whetstone sharpens tools. Thinking sharpens products. Both require friction.

*Currently building Spar — an iOS app that sharpens fuzzy thinking through confrontational AI dialogue.*
